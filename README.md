# BountyHub - Decentralized Bounty Management Platform

A **decentralized bounty management platform** built on the Algorand Testnet using AlgoKit.

It solves trust issues in freelance and hackathon-style bounty systems by introducing:

🔐 **On-chain escrow for every bounty**
💰 **Secure fund locking inside smart contracts**
⚖ **Transparent approval & payout logic**
📜 **Immutable state tracking**


## 🌟 What It Does

**BountyHub enables:**

🧑‍💻 **Creators** to post bounties with locked escrow funds  
👨‍🔧 **Workers** to submit work on-chain  
🔐 **Smart contract–secured** payout logic  
⚡ **Transparent and tamper-proof** fund management  

**Unlike traditional bounty platforms, funds are secured by an Algorand smart contract — eliminating trust issues between creators and contributors.**

## 🎯 Problem Statement

### RIFT Track: Build on Algorand


**Freelance bounty platforms today rely on centralized trust, leading to payment disputes, delayed settlements, and lack of transparency between creators and contributors.**

### Our Interpretation

Freelance and hackathon bounty systems suffer from:
- ❌ **Payment disputes** - Who paid whom?
- ❌ **Lack of transparency** - Centralized database
- ❌ **Manual verification** - No automated proof
- ❌ **Centralized control** - Platform owns the system
- ❌ **Trust issues** - Both parties at risk

### Our Solution

An Algorand **smart contract–powered bounty escrow system** that:

✅ Locks funds inside an **Application Account**  
✅ Verifies submission logic **on-chain**  
✅ Releases funds only when **conditions are satisfied**  
✅ Maintains transparent state via **blockchain**  
✅ Zero intermediaries between creator and worker

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Smart Contract Layer (Algorand)

Built using:
- ✅ **AlgoKit** - Official Algorand development framework
- ✅ **PyTeAL / Beaker** - Python-based smart contract language
- ✅ **Deployed on Algorand Testnet** - App ID: 755780805

#### Contract Responsibilities

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `create_bounty()` | Locks escrow funds in Application Account |
| `claim()` | Worker claims bounty (can only claim once) |
| `submit_work()` | Worker submits completed work on-chain |
| `approve_work()` | Creator approves & releases payment |


#### On-Chain Storage

```
Global State
├── creator: Address      # Who created the bounty
├── worker: Address       # Who claimed the bounty  
├── amount: UInt64        # Bounty amount (microAlgos)
└── status: UInt64        # 0=Active, 1=Claimed, 2=Completed

Application Account
└── Holds escrow funds securely until approval
```

### Frontend Layer

Built using:
- **React + TypeScript** - Modern UI framework
- **Wallet Integration** - Pera Wallet / Defly / MyAlgo
- **Algorand JS SDK** - Direct Algod API calls
- **Atomic Transaction Grouping** - Secure multi-step transactions

### Transaction Flow

**Step 1: Bounty Creation**
```
Creator → Frontend → Build ApplicationCreateTxn
       → Sign with Wallet
       → Send to Blockchain
       → Extract App ID → Save to localStorage
```

**Step 2: Escrow Funding**
```
Creator → Frontend → Build PaymentTxn to App Account
       → Group with AppCall
       → Sign & Send
       → Funds locked in Application Account
```

**Step 3: Work Submission**
```
Worker  → Frontend → Opt-in to Application
       → Call claim() method
       → Updates on-chain state
```

**Step 4: Payment Release**
```
Creator → Frontend → Call approve()
       → Smart contract validates
       → Atomic transfer to worker
       → Payment complete ✅
```

## � Why This Project Meaningfully Uses Algorand

This project demonstrates blockchain use cases **beyond simple payments**:

### ✅ Smart Contract Escrow Management
```
Traditional:     Creator → Platform → Worker
BountyHub:       Creator → Smart Contract Account → Worker
                 (Funds locked until conditions met)
```

### ✅ Atomic Transaction Grouping
```
Multi-step logic executed atomically:
1. Verifyapproval condition
2. Transfer from escrow account
3. All succeed or all fail - no partial states
```

### ✅ On-Chain State Management
```
Global State (immutable record):
├── creator:  Who posted the bounty
├── worker:   Who claimed it
├── amount:   Bounty value
└── status:   Current state (Active → Claimed → Completed)
```

### ✅ Application Account Model
```
Each bounty gets its own app-controlled account:
├── Holds escrow funds securely
├── Only releases with creator approval
├── Can't be accessed by any single user
└── Transparent & verifiable on blockchain
```

### ✅ AlgoKit Framework Integration
```
Uses official Algorand toolkit:
✅ Smart contract scaffolding
✅ Deployment pipeline
✅ Testing framework
✅ LocalNet development
✅ Production deployment
```


| Aspect | Why Algorand Matters |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Escrow** | Smart contract enforces conditions, not platform |
| **Trust** | Cryptographic verification, not corporate policy |
| **Transparency** | Every transaction on immutable ledger |
| **Speed** | 4-second finality (vs. traditional 3-5 days) |
| **Cost** | $0.001 per transaction (vs. 20-30% platform fee) |
| **Ownership** | User controls their keys, not platform |
